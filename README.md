#### Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science. We used it here to deploy our project as a web app. It made it easy to create an interactive user interface for exploring and visualizing the raw image and extrated data and to provide great user interface to get user input.

#### EasyOCR

Easyocr is a Python library for optical character recognition (OCR). It simplifies the process of extracting text from images by providing an interface to pre-trained OCR models. We used it here to extract text from business card images, enabling the automated extraction of information such as name, designation, company name, etc.

#### Regex

re is the in-built regular expression library in Python. It provides functions and patterns for pattern matching and text manipulation. In this project, we used it for pattern matching and searching tasks, such as extracting phone numbers or email addresses from the extracted text.

#### Difflib

Difflib is a library that provides classes and functions for comparing sequences and calculating differences between them. It uses distance algorithms like levenshtein distance. In this project, we used it to compare and find similarities between different state names list and the name of state in business cards.

#### Pandas

Pandas is a popular Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. We used pandas to convert extracted info stored in database into dataframe inorder to display and to convert dataframe into .csv, .json and .dict formats.

#### Numpy

Numpy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides high-performance arrays and mathematical functions that can be used for various calculations and computations. We used it here to handle converted image data.

1. Business Networking: The app simplifies the process of digitizing and managing business card information. It allows users to quickly extract and store contact details, making it easier to connect and network with individuals and businesses.

2. Contact Management: The app serves as a digital repository for organizing and storing contact information. Users can easily update, search, and manage their contacts in one centralized location, eliminating the need for physical business cards or scattered contact lists.

3. Data Extraction and Analysis: The app's extraction capabilities allow for the automated extraction of relevant data from business cards, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. This data can be further analyzed and used for various purposes, such as lead generation, market research, or customer profiling.

4. Streamlined Business Processes: By automating the extraction and management of business card information, the app saves time and effort. It streamlines business processes, allowing users to focus on meaningful interactions and business activities rather than manual data entry and organization.


## Potential issues with the app

1. ##### Variability in Business Card Designs:

   The app relies on specific patterns and regular expressions to extract information from business cards. However, different card designs, fonts, font sizes, spacing, and structural variations can impact the accuracy of the extraction process. Users may need to customize or adapt the regular expressions to match their specific card layouts.

2. ##### Accuracy of OCR and Text Matching:

   EasyOCR accuracy and difflib accuracy can have limitations and may result in false matches or mismatches, affecting the overall performance of the app.

3. ##### Image Quality and Challenges:

   The quality of business card images can vary, and low-resolution or poorly captured images may lead to inaccurate OCR results. Users should ensure that they capture or scan clear and well-lit images for better extraction accuracy. Furthermore, complex card designs with intricate graphics or unconventional layouts may pose challenges for accurate data extraction.

4. ##### Limitations in Streamlit Cloud Environment:

   The app relies on a local database connection to store and retrieve business card data. However, Streamlit Cloud does not currently provide proper support for connecting to local databases from cloud-deployed applications and this is under development using st.experimental_connection() right now. As a result, this app won't work in a Streamlit Cloud environment without additional modifications or alternative cloud database hosting options.
